In "Research question" we presented you the area of interest for which we want to train our model(s). However, as training the algorithms is resource- and time-intensive, we decided to limit the area used for training to the extend you can see above. Moreover, the original image was shot by a drone flying relatively low and, therefore, has a rather high resolution of 1cm per pixel. As this high resolution was not important for the given task and to further reduce resource-intensity, we resampled the image to a 10cm resolution, using a mean value interpolation method (IS THIS TRUE?!).

* image consists of 3 layers: R, G, B; each of them values from 0-255
* used R package from Reudenbach to get all the other layers
* used IDONTKNOW to reduce layers to important ones
